__Dear Kyle,__
<br>
__You finally made a change and started. Aren’t you glad you did?__
<br>
__Yours Truly,__
<br>
__Your 18 year old self.__
<br>This is going to be my first blog post where I introduce myself. I am an aspiring Machine Learning engineer who specializes in python, but my journey has been all self-taught which means that my experience entirely depends on my discipline. The only person who knows of my work is my dad who talks about his job in connection with my desired career. 
<br>With that being said, that means that self-discipline is directly related to my success, and after watching Daniel Bourke’s video, I now strive to balance out my levels of Creation vs. Consumption. I do not know what this is going to turn out, but this is something I have wanted to do alongside a YouTube channel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this is a perfect time for me to explore my passions.
