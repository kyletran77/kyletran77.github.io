Recently, I had a moment of an identity crisis from a milk tea shop. No, no, no, I know what you are thinking....no, I did not get beat up or had some crazy person judge me. Three words were said to me:
__“Sorry, we’re closed.” __

I had shown up to the place with my friend at 9:59 p.m, but they closed at 10pm. And I just left. At the moment, I had no care. “All well, we can go somewhere else.” Five minutes later, it had hit me. Why didn’t I say anything back to the worker? They, technically, were not closed. 
I kept replaying that moment and made excuses for myself saying that I understand that they were tired and wanted to go home.

That was never like me. Even though that may sound selfish, my dad has always lectured me about the life of managers, directors, or CEOs, and I have always wanted to lead my own team. I have been known to be very blunt or even sometimes ‘mean’. My dad even had to sit me down and tell me that I was becoming a bully. WOW. Even my dad believed I was getting too brutal, but it was never physical rather through my words.

Was the tea place the place where I realized what I was a wuss? Maybe I have changed or I have always actually been a person to walk over this whole time. Maybe my whole life or persona is a facade.

Wait, I just told you that he wanted me to be a leader, aren’t natural born leaders pricks? Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, Tan Hawk, etc. they are known to be the worst people to work with, but they revolutionized the world. So leaders are pricks, right? I watched YouTube videos, read articles and books, and analyzed successful people’s lives. The answer I came up with is...maybe?

What makes someone a natural leader? Typical responses are that they are creative, mean, or lonely. We have heard of the phrase “it is lonely at the top”- is it the result of being an ass? So many questions, but there are no clear answers.

I finally noticed a pattern between them - they did not allow anything or ANYONE to stand in their path. I like to use the analogy that they are like AI programs. If you are not specific on certain parameters, then they will achieve their goal at all cost, regardless of what it takes. For example, you can ask them to find a solution to have world peace. Do you know what they are going to do? They are going to eradicate all species on earth, even humans. Technically, that is world peace...

It is like determination but on steroids… No, I’m not telling you to disregard your manners or ignore the people in need. Those revolutionary individuals are amazing at what they do, but their issue was not being able to draw the line between being kind and determined. Do you want the people around you with a burning passion? Or be so nice that individuals take advantage of you? 

The correct answer really lies in you. Even after all of the research, I can not write a clear pathway to be on track to be the next Bill Gates because there is no reason to be a stupendous leader when it is just not you. Of course, I could tell you to just chase your dreams and wake up at 5am and bathe in cold showers and...but those things you hear that eccentric billionaires do daily does not work for everyone, trust me, I’ve tried.

It may be corny, but just be you and most importantly, honest because I believe that honesty and toughness is a lot more similar than one thinks. By being yourself, firm, and truthful, people will respect the confidence in your decisions in life and career. If people continue to say that you are mean, then let them. In the end, one should understand that it isn’t possible to be lonely if you are in love with yourself. Like Jobs once said, “Your commercials suck...” Be like Steve.
